  If a GPS waypoint is set, the vehicle will automatically navigate toward the destination.

  Players can regain control by steering or pressing the brake at any time.

- **Alerts**  
  - **Attention Warning**: If the vehicle becomes unstable, the system will prompt the player to stay alert.

- **Tesla-style Sound Effects**  
  The plugin includes sound effects inspired by Tesla's driving system to enhance the immersive experience.



## Usage

- Press **Y** to activate **Autonomous Navigation Assist** or **Lane-Keeping Assist** (depending on the situation).
